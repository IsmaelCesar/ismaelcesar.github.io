# What's a solutionary?
I first heard this term being used by Brazilian university students and teachers when refering to a document with detailed solutions of a specific textbook with the goal of better understanding the problem solving process, or to better understand the topics of the book.

Basically, a solution dictionary. __A solutionary!__

### What should you expect from this page and from the _solutionaries_?
This page displays a collection of of the _solutionaries_ I'm currently working on. My goal with those solutions is to be meticulous, regardless of how trivial the solution might be.
In the solutionaries, you'll find solutions to most of the textbooks I have used over my academic career. Please, take note that __those solutions are not garanteed to be corect__, their main purpose is to help other people taking courses that use the textbooks refered to in this page, or who are self studying.
